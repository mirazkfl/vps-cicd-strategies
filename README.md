## 🎯 Quick Start

Choose the deployment strategy that fits your needs:

| Strategy | Best For | Setup Time | Link |
|----------|----------|------------|------|
| **Version 1** | Simple apps, fast deployments | ⚡ 5 min | [v1-do-rsync-pm2](./v1-do-rsync-pm2/) |
| **Version 1.5** | Mission-critical apps, instant rollbacks | ⚡ 5 min | [v1.5-do-rsync-atomic-pm2](./v1.5-do-rsync-atomic-pm2/) |
| **Version 2** | Teams preferring Git-based workflows | ⚡ 10 min | [v2-do-git-pm2](./v2-do-git-pm2/) |

## 📦 Deployment Strategies Overview

### Version 1: Rsync + PM2 Cluster

**Strategy:** Build on CI → Rsync artifacts → PM2 zero-downtime reload

- ✅ **Fastest deployment** (no server-side build)
- ✅ **Minimal server footprint** (no source code on server)
- ✅ **Zero downtime** with PM2 cluster mode
- ✅ **PR preview deployments** support
- ✅ **Staging environments** support

**Use when:** You want the fastest, simplest deployment with maximum security.

---

### Version 1.5: Atomic Deployment (Rsync + Symlink)

**Strategy:** Build on CI → Upload to timestamped release → Atomic symlink switch

- ✅ **Instant rollbacks** (no rebuild needed)
- ✅ **Partial failure protection** (incomplete uploads don't break site)
- ✅ **Release history** (keep last 5 releases)
- ✅ **Zero downtime** deployments
- ✅ **PR preview deployments** support
- ✅ **Staging environments** support

**Use when:** You need instant rollback capability and maximum reliability.

📖 [Full Documentation](./v1.5-do-rsync-atomic-pm2/README.md)

---

### Version 2: Git Pull + Server Build

**Strategy:** GitHub Action triggers → Server pulls code → Server builds app

- ✅ **Familiar Git workflow**
- ✅ **No artifact management** needed
- ✅ **Server-side builds** (good for large monorepos)
- ✅ **Automatic dependency updates**

**Use when:** You prefer Git-based workflows and have sufficient server resources.
